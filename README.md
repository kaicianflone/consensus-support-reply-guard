# consensus-support-reply-guard

Policy guard for customer support replies generated by humans or agents.

`consensus-support-reply-guard` reviews a proposed reply and returns:

- `ALLOW`
- `BLOCK`
- `REQUIRE_REWRITE`

before the response is sent.

## Why teams use it

Support replies carry legal, trust, and escalation risk. This guard reduces silent failure propagation by forcing explicit review signals and deterministic policy checks.

## Core features

- hard-block taxonomy for unsafe reply patterns
- strict schema validation and unknown-field rejection
- weighted persona consensus
- idempotent decision replay
- board-native decision artifacts for traceability

## Typical use cases

- high-severity incidents
- billing and refund communications
- policy-sensitive support channels
- regulated customer environments

## Quick start

```bash
npm i
node --import tsx run.js --input ./examples/input.json
```

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

## Continuous improvement
